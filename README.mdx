# bf-tools
some pre-built commands for working with brainfuck programs.
## install
1. if you haven't already, install mingw.
2. run the following in the terminal:
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/mysticaldumbo/bf-tools.git
cd bf-tools
g++ bf.cpp -o bf.exe
g++ bfc.cpp -o bfc.exe
```
3. add the bf-tools folder to your path.
## features
as of now, this only supports 2 commands, them being bf and  bfc. here's how they work:
### bf
bf simply runs a .bf file.<br/>
usage:
```bash
bf example.bf
```
### bfc
bf simply compiles a .bf file.<br/>
usage:
```bash
bfc example.bf
```
## how it works
### bf
bf uses a c++ file to read each memory cell of the brainfuck program and output whatever the brainfuck program wants it to.
### bfc
bfc uses a c++ file to read each memory cell and create a temporary c file where it uses c code to add each braifuck memory cell and then uses gcc to compile the c file into exe, effectively creating a compiled brainfuck program.
